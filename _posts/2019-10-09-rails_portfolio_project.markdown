For my third portfolio project I was tasked with making a rails app. I decided to go with a semi-anonymous writers workshop that I called Good Writes. Writers would be able to create and join workshop groups based on what form their piece was (Poetry, Fiction, Non-Fiction). They would then participate in presenting their piece and commenting on other's pieces.

I began the project without any code this time but instead using a database visualization app. This way I could map out all my db relations and even my app as a whole. With the database mapped, I knew exactly what needed to be done and when, and also had a reference while I was creating it.

The second thing I learned to do before coding the app itself, was rspec tests. I set myself a goal of at least one test per commit. While at first figuring out how to write tests was time consuming and felt aimless, eventually I got to a point where it was beneficially and didn't take much time at all to write. Later on in my app, when I began to refactor and add in new features on top of others, I could run the tests and see exactly what I broke, saving so much time that I might have spent debugging.

React as a framework feels like it's going to save my javascript experience. While using javascript is powerful and essential to a truly interactive website, vanilla JS feels lackluster and disorganized coming from Ruby. However, React fixes almost all of this. It turns the language into something that just works. It abstracts so many needless and tiring processes to help you get your webpage functional as fast as possible. This ranges from setting up your environment to quickly creating components and keeping track of them. It also does this in, what I percieve as, an effecient and fast manner. React also does all this in a familiar, object oriented way, with separation of concerns, reusable logic, etc. As someone coming from Rails, one such similarity, the component lifecycle methods, bears a striking resemblence to the object lifecycle methods of Rails. It's so familiar and easy to use that if I had used it for my first JS project, I think I would have taken half or less time to complete it. However, forcing myself to use vanilla javascript definitely gave me a deeper understanding for the language itself which I find immensely useful. All in all, I'm excited to see where my first project with React will go as I feel like it enables me to do so much more without worrying about the tedious stuff.
